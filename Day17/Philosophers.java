/**
 * A group of weak-sighted philosophers gathered around a circular table to
 * have dinner together. They were served on one big round plate in the middle
 * of the table, and they were given a fork each (so there was a fork on the
 * table between every two adjacent philosophers). In order to prevent
 * everybody to take food at the same time, risking their clumsy hands hacking
 * at their neighboursâ€™ with the forks, the philosophers discussed and agreed
 * to adhere to the following protocol: each philosopher could only get food
 * if it had grabbed both forks on their left and their right.
 *
 * Write a program that implements a dinner with n philosophers and n forks.
 * Make sure that each fork can be grabbed by only one philosopher at a time.
 * Verify that a naive synchronisation strategy can lead very quickly to a
 * deadlock (when/why does this happen?); fix the program so that this cannot
 * happen.
