If the difference between the entered birth year is greater than 17, print "It seems you are an adult.", 
otherwise, print "It seems you are not an adult."


2. 

i begins at 10, and only ever increases, so it will never be less than 5. So the condition in the while loop
will never be false, and there will be an infinite loop.


3. 

The program reads a number, i. The program then repeats the loop body (10 - i) times (or 0, if 10 - i is negative).
In each iteration of the loop body, the program reads a number. If the number is 0, the loop ends. 
If the number is not 0 or 1, the program prints that number. Once the loop has ended (either because 0 was entered,
or because it has been repeated 10 - i times), the program prints "finished".
